### Updates Summary:

1. **Axion AI** integration has moved from **phase 4** into full AI optimizations for ternary operations and rollback capabilities.
2. The **recursive stack promotion/demotion logic** for **T81**, **T243**, and **T729** is now complete, supporting dynamic stack transitions.
3. **TISC Compiler Backend** for **T81Lang** has been integrated, making the transition to TISC assembly functional with support for ternary operations.
4. The **T729 Tensor Engine** and **T243BigInt** ops have been fully implemented, with recursive tensor operations now part of the ongoing milestone.
