@* README.cweb | Literate Documentation for HanoiVM + Axion AI Runtime

This document describes the architecture and usage of the HanoiVM project,
including the Axion AI kernel module system, the ternary computing runtime
emulation layer, and the newly integrated cryptographic systems for secure execution.

@<Project Overview@>=
## üß† Project Overview

**HanoiVM** is a recursive, ternary virtual machine framework designed to explore
post-binary computing paradigms. It operates using base-3 arithmetic units (`T81`)
and features a stack-driven execution model inspired by the Tower of Hanoi puzzle.

**Axion AI** is the kernel-level execution and optimization module, built as an
AI-native runtime system that supports:
- Ternary AI stack logic (mod-3)
- Entropy-aware rollback
- Anomaly detection and self-healing
- NLP-style interface commands

In addition, **NIST-approved cryptographic extensions** have been integrated, enabling:
- AES-NI accelerated AES encryption
- RSA encryption and decryption
- SHA-256 hashing
- Secure key generation and random number generation

These cryptographic enhancements ensure that HanoiVM operates securely in sensitive environments, aligned with modern security practices.

Together, these systems form a research prototype for AI-native, ternary-powered
operating environments, with enhanced cryptographic integrity.

@<T81 Integration@>=

üîó T81 Integration

HanoiVM is designed to align with the T81 computing paradigm, which provides a robust foundation for ternary computing:

T81TISC: Ternary Instruction Set Computer
HanoiVM leverages T81TISC to enable logarithmic processing for AI, cryptography, and parallel computing tasks. T81's self-optimizing execution adapts in real-time, enhancing performance dynamically as workloads evolve.
T81Lang: Code the Future
The project integrates T81Lang, a programming language built for Base-81 arithmetic, which is designed to work seamlessly within the HanoiVM environment for AI-driven and high-performance computing tasks.
T81 Data Types: Precision Meets Power
T81 introduces arbitrary-precision numbers and tensor-based data structures, which are ideal for handling complex scientific computations and deep learning tasks. HanoiVM supports T81 data types, making it perfect for scientific breakthroughs and machine learning applications.
T81 Virtual Machine: Run Anywhere, Anytime
HanoiVM features JIT (Just-In-Time) compilation and cross-platform compatibility, allowing it to run efficiently on various platforms, making T81 accessible and adaptable across the globe.
Axion AI: Intelligence That Works for You
Axion AI optimizes the performance of HanoiVM in real-time by predicting and adjusting resource allocation. With Axion AI, the system features autonomous threat detection and blockchain-backed integrity, ensuring both efficiency and security for T81 environments.
@<Cryptographic Enhancements@>=

üîê Cryptographic Enhancements

This version of HanoiVM integrates NIST-approved encryption libraries, providing robust, secure cryptographic operations that are essential for modern secure computing environments.

AES-NI: Accelerated AES encryption using hardware support on compatible systems, ensuring fast and secure data encryption.
RSA: Public-key encryption and decryption for secure communications and key management.
SHA-256: Secure hashing algorithm for data integrity verification and cryptographic applications.
Key Generation: Secure generation of AES keys and RSA keypairs with secure random number generation.
These cryptographic features are implemented in the nist_encryption.cweb module, which is designed to provide secure encryption, decryption, and hashing in a ternary computing environment.
