# HanoiVM

HanoiVM is a recursive ternary virtual machine built to explore symbolic computing using base-81 logic. Designed as part of the broader Axion + T81Lang ecosystem, HanoiVM simulates a Ternary Instruction Set Computer (TISC) architecture with support for AI integration, ternary recursion, and future hardware acceleration.

## Features

- 🔺 81-bit ternary operand architecture (`uint81_t`)
- 🔁 Recursive stack modes (T81, T243, T729)
- 🧠 Built-in symbolic opcodes for AI (e.g., `TNN_ACCUM`, `T81_MATMUL`)
- 📄 `.cweb` literate source files for modular documentation + code
- 🧪 CI-integrated test suite with `.hvm` bytecode disassembler
- ⚙️ Designed to connect to Axion AI and Project Looking Glass
