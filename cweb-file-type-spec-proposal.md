Below is an overview of our extended .cweb file‐type specification as used within AxionAI. This spec not only covers the traditional literate programming structure but also incorporates additional metadata and directives to support package management, live compilation, and even JIT compilation features.

1. Overall Structure

A .cweb file is a single, self-contained document that interleaves human‐readable documentation with source code. Its structure is designed so that:

Documentation Sections provide context, explanation, and formatted output (often via TeX or HTML).
Code Sections are marked for extraction (via ctangle) and can be compiled or executed dynamically.
Metadata Blocks extend the traditional CWEB format to include package management and runtime configuration information.


2. File Header and Metadata

At the very start of a .cweb file, you can include a metadata block. This section contains directives that describe the package and its operational context:

Directives:
Use special markers (often prefixed with @) to define:
Package Name: e.g., @pkg AxionAI-Module
Version: e.g., @version 1.0.0
Dependencies: e.g., @dep SomeLibrary
Author/Contact: e.g., @author
JIT/Live Compilation Settings: Optional tags such as @jit enable or @live-stream true
Example:
@* Package Metadata
@pkg AxionAI-Module
@version 1.0.0
@dep LibFoo, LibBar
@jit enable
@live-stream true
This header is parsed by AxionAI’s package manager to automate build processes and manage runtime dependencies.


3. Documentation Sections

Purpose:
These sections provide detailed explanations, design rationale, and usage examples.
Format:
They are written in plain text and can include rich formatting (such as TeX commands or markdown-like syntax).
Delimitation:
Documentation is typically free-form and separated from code blocks by the absence of code delimiters or specific control characters.
Example:
@* Introduction
This module demonstrates live streaming compilation and JIT capabilities.
The code below implements a simple example.


4. Code Sections

Identification:
Code blocks are clearly marked using special delimiters such as:
@<...@> for named code sections (to allow modular reordering and inclusion).
@{ ... @} to enclose a contiguous block of source code.
Modularity:
Named code sections can be referenced multiple times. This supports the idea that the final executable code’s order may differ from the order presented in the document.
Extraction:
Tools like ctangle process these blocks, extracting them in a sequence dictated by cross-references.

Example:

@<Include Libraries@>
#include <stdio.h>

@<Main Function@>
int main() {
    printf("Hello, AxionAI!");
    return 0;
}


5. Extraction and Compilation Directives

ctangle Commands:
These commands tell the extraction tool which parts of the document form the final source code. The typical usage is implicit when you define named sections.


cweave Commands:
Use these directives to generate formatted documentation that includes both code and commentary.


Live and JIT Specifics:
With AxionAI’s extensions, additional directives may be included:
Triggering Live Updates: e.g., @live-update might signal the system to recompile immediately upon file change.

JIT Compilation Hints: Tags such as @optimize or @profile can be used to influence how the JIT engine handles specific code blocks.


6. Conventions and Best Practices

Separation of Concerns:
Keep explanatory text and source code clearly separated by their markers. This ensures that automated tools can reliably parse and extract the desired content.


Modular Design:
Break your code into well-named sections so that the extraction tool can reorder them if necessary. This modularity aids in debugging and live updates.
Documentation Consistency:
Make sure that changes in code are accompanied by updates in the corresponding documentation. The strength of literate programming lies in its seamless integration of code and explanation.


Example Full Structure:

@* Package Metadata
@pkg AxionAI-Module
@version 1.0.0
@dep LibFoo, LibBar
@jit enable
@live-stream true

@* Introduction
This document serves as a self-contained module for AxionAI,
demonstrating live streaming and JIT compilation.

@* Libraries
@<Include Libraries@>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

@* Main Function
@<Main Function@>
int main() {
    printf("Live JIT compilation in AxionAI!\n");
    return 0;
}


Summary

The .cweb file-type specification for AxionAI is a robust, flexible format that combines:

Metadata Blocks for package management and runtime configuration.
Documentation Sections for comprehensive in-line commentary.
Code Sections marked for dynamic extraction and live compilation.
Additional Directives for live updates and JIT compilation support.
This unified approach not only streamlines development but also enhances maintainability, transparency, and rapid iteration within the AxionAI ecosystem.
