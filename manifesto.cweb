When you could be accused of creating something that could be used for bad; best not to keep/compile local. Unknown waters; I am not perfect and truthfully
I am learning along the way. I will let AI outline my homework and align as efficiently as possible until then.

Please note, this was made possible by xAI & OpenAI at different places that I don't know where to give each specific credit. However OpenAI has carried the brunt of this effort.
Thank you for the new tools and methods possible! We all have our aptitudes. This was a concerted effort to use what I know; augmented in 2025 by Artifical Intelligence.
