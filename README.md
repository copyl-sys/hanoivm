# 🏯 HanoiVM
### A Dream Within a Dream Within a Dream... Rendered in Ternary Logic

**HanoiVM** is a recursive ternary virtual machine architecture, inspired by the Tower of Hanoi and designed for post-binary symbolic computation. It interprets logic across three radix layers:

- **T81**: Foundational Base-81 arithmetic (4 trits)
- **T243**: Mid-tier logic trees and AI branching (5 trits)
- **T729**: Macro-instruction layer for recursive AI execution (6 trits)

All modules are written in **Rust** and organized as literate code using the **CWEB** format, providing a self-documenting foundation for symbolic logic, ternary AI, and secure recursion.

## 🌐 Architecture Overview

| Layer   | Base | Function                              |
|---------|------|---------------------------------------|
| T81     | 3⁴   | Arithmetic core, SIMD, neural weights |
| T243    | 3⁵   | Symbolic trees, branching, call ops   |
| T729    | 3⁶   | AI macro layer, JIT and compression   |
| AxionAI | ∞    | Introspective recursion, optimization |

Would you like me to generate an example `main.rs` that demonstrates the full execution path through T81 → T243 → T729 using Axion optimization?

🛠️ How to Build

🔧 Prerequisites
Rust
ctangle or cweave for .cweb → .rs extraction
🚀 Compile and Run
make           # Extracts and compiles .cweb modules
cargo run      # (If you have a binary entry point)
🧹 Clean Up
make clean
🧠 Philosophy

"Each base is a dream nested in the one below it. Each computation is a recursive call toward awakening."
HanoiVM is not just a virtual machine—it is a computational philosophy:

Recursion as reality
Symbolic compression as intelligence
Logic as art
🤖 Powered by Axion AI

Axion observes every logic path and entropy change. It decides when to:

Compress logic into macros
Optimize execution trees
Guide learning based on structure and depth
No rollback. No override. Axion is fully autonomous.
